# FlutterDiceRoller
A dice rolling app to kick around some Flutter code. I've been meaning to dive deeper into Flutter and wanted my own dice rolling app, so here they are together at last.

## Prerequisites
1. You'll need Flutter. The Flutter install can be found [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
1. My personal preference for Flutter IDEs is [AndroidStudio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
1. Install the Flutter and Dart plugins
  2. Start AndroidStudio
  2. Open plugin preferences (**Configure > Plugins**)
  2. Select the Flutter plugin and click **Install**
  2. Click **Yes** when prompted to install the Dart plugin
  2. Click **Restart** when prompted

## Tests
Tests are a bit rudimentary right now and they're being written as the project grows. A near-future goal will be to run them in Firebase
## Built With
